Hello there.

This is my Craft Beer Webshop project made with React,NextJs and TailwindCss.

For starting the project:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure
The project is structured with the following directories:

pages: Contains the various pages of the webshop.

components: Houses reusable components, including the product display and the navbar.

## Planned Features
I have several features in mind for this project to enhance its functionality and user experience:

User Registration: Implement user registration functionality to allow customers to create accounts.

User Login: Create a user login system to authenticate customers.

User Profile Page: Develop a user profile page where customers can manage their account information.

Beer Catalog Page: Build a dedicated page to showcase the variety of beers available for purchase.

Ordering Page: Design an ordering page that allows customers to add beers to their cart and complete the purchase process.

Future Development
In the future, I plan to integrate a database to handle user orders and profiles, making the webshop more interactive and user-friendly.

Please feel free to contribute or provide feedback on this project to help improve it further.
