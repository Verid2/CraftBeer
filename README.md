Hello there.

This is my Craft Beer Webshop project made with React,NextJs and TailwindCss.

For starting the project:
```bash
npm run dev
```

For modifying the content of the pages there is a pages folder and components folder.
In the components at the moment i have a product which is handleing the various beer's what will be sold.
And also have a simple navbar component.

Later I would like to modify the page with a db for handling the orders and the users.


Features I like to add:
-Registering
-Login
-User page
-Page for the beers
-Ordering page
